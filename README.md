Personal Project: Although I aspire to read regularly, thick books do intimidate me. However, the learnings and insights from my choices of text are undoubtedly applicable in the society we live in today, inspiring us to take the leap that sets us on the right path, and valuable now and in years to come. So, I need the following:
1) Avoid reading the Bhagavad Gita
2) Absorb learnings so I now and then, at important junctures of my life, I can quote and pretend to be Oppenheimer
3) Focus on daily growth rather than committing to instead read, perhaps capture learning, application, and improvement.
